# OW Script Collection
A collection of overwatch workshop scripts wrote by me and rework from popular game codes focusing peformance and bug fixes.

# Usage
You can play all modes that i've created, i just request one thing. Don't edit and publish as owner of code, this make all workshop creators sad and unmotivated to create gamemodes. When i publish some code that isn't mine (reworked or created from stratch) i will create an dedicated `README.md` inside that folder to tell where i found and which is possible original author plus extra info.

I usually prefer save cool modes in github to preserve the gamemode. I still have many gamemodes presets saved from OW1, will try publish later.

If you wanna modify any code in workshop from any creator least give credits. For example in 500% mode in hollywood map nobody know who created this mode, i remember because was created in PTR during workshop beta test in OW1 and the player that created the code was japanese or korean (i don't recall correctly which language exactly). So an player months after (that i prefer don't expose his BTag, but him speak english) copied and pasted the code many and many times as "owner" and was spamming making many lobbies from his copied mode just to keep the code on "Popular" tab.

If you wanna edit code and is too big to workshop mode description, add an link to an [`Gist`](https://gist.github.com/) with an `README.md` on gist to display full description of mode and original creator plus people that have modified.

# Compilation
You must install <b>[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)</b> with <b>[OverPy](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Zezombye.overpy)</b> extension installed also. Then clone repository and usually find and `main.opy` in each folder. It's main script for all scripts i create, this will group all imports, variables and macros into a single file to fast and simple compilation. 

# My Own Codes
‚ùå = Discontinuated <br>
‚ö† = I Don't Remember If Still Working<br>
üí§ = On Hold<br>
‚úÖ = Playable<br>

<hr>

- Angry Escort (‚ùå): Basically enemies get stronger each time you kill them like enemy waves.

- Hero Tycoon (‚ùå): To be decided, basically an hero tycoon with dummy bots.

- Escape From Roadhog (‚ö†): Basically an chaser roadhog will attempt to chase everyone in his LOS.

- Rio Invasion (üí§): Same as angry escort, but dedicated to Para√≠so map. There some lore i've created in my mind in this mode. Basically enemy null sector units invaded Lucio's house, and your team must defeat enemy units till you reach Lucio's house. (Its incomplete lore, because i've used wrong gamemode: Escort, i will change soon to Skirmish and add some secondary objectives and some hero conversation, etc to make gamemode more interesting)

- Mei Snowball Offensive (‚úÖ): Basically an prototype based on mei's snowball offensive from arcade but with some additions (tested today at 9:30AM BRT-3).

- DBD-REMAKE (‚ö†/‚ùå): Basically an rework to existing (and gone) DBD mode. My objective is recreate this mode to give chance to both sides win. TL;DR make balanced for both team sides (lets try AI based killer?).

- NoClip (‚úÖ): Basically an noclip. You can fly in map without collision and gravity to explore some map areas (like i've discovered secret door in King's Row for alternative payload path like they promised in OW2 annoucement videos).
