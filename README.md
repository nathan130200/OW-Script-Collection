# OW Script Collection
A collection of overwatch workshop scripts wrote by me and rework from popular game codes focusing peformance and bug fixes.

# Usage
You can play all modes that i've created, i just request one thing. Don't edit and publish as owner of code, this make all workshop creators sad and unmotivated to create gamemodes. When i publish some code that isn't mine (reworked or created from stratch) i will create an dedicated `README.md` inside that folder to tell where i found and which is possible original author plus extra info.

I usually prefer save cool modes in github to preserve the gamemode. I still have many gamemodes presets saved from OW1, will try publish later.

If you wanna modify any code in workshop from any creator least give credits. For example in 500% mode in hollywood map nobody know who created this mode, i remember because was created in PTR during workshop beta test in OW1 and the player that created the code was japanese or korean (i don't recall correctly which language exactly). So an player months after (that i prefer don't expose his BTag, but him speak english) copied and pasted the code many and many times as "owner" and was spamming making many lobbies from his copied mode just to keep the code on "Popular" tab.

If you wanna edit code and is too big to workshop mode description, add an link to an [`Gist`](https://gist.github.com/) with an `README.md` on gist to display full description of mode and original creator plus people that have modified.
